Extracting data on hospital's resources requests from PDF reports.

By Manuel Villa.

This repository shows the methodoloy used to obtain the data published in the story by The Seattle Times, [How the coronavirus overwhelmed Washington stateâ€™s early efforts to contain it ](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/times-watchdog/lost-battle-how-coronavirus-overwhelmed-washington-states-efforts-to-contain-it/), published on 5 April 2020.

The results are summarized in the comprehensive vizualization by [Emily Eng](https://github.com/emilymeng) you can see at the bottom of this README.

Staff reporter Dan Gilbert issued a request to the Washington State Military Department for records of all equipment orders made by state hospitals since the beginnig of 2020. We obtained the 70 PDF files saved down in the folder *source_data/pdf*, in this repository. The objective was to convert these files into structured data.

Not having time nor the will to reinvent the wheel, we followed the least-resistance approach: to use [Tabula](https://tabula.technology/). This marvelous tool efficiently converts PDFs that contain tables into CSV, JSON, or structured data formats. The tradeoff for such conveninece, however, is that those PDF tables need to in pristine shape for Tabula to efficiently recognize and convert them. That was not the case with the records we obtained. So to use it, we would first need to overhaul the PDFs to Tabula's taste. This is how we did it:

There are two scripts in the reopsitory:

**script_01_crop_fest_python.ipynb**
The PDFs had a lot of information that we did not need. Not only that, but that information's layout in the PDF kept throwing Tabula off. This script cropped away areas from all pages that constituted nothing but noise. Then we produced new PDFs that did not include those unnecessary areas and fed them to Tabula.

**script_02_data_cleaning_and_analysis.ipynb**
After feeding the cropped PDFs to Tabula, it very kindly produced CSV files that contained the data it scraped off from them. This was still very raw data that needed a lot of polishing and standardizing. This script did that.
